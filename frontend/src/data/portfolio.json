Instead of relying on rate-limited public APIs, it observes DOM price transitions in a live browser session to replicate the exact updates traders see. A Node.js + TypeScript backend streams normalized price events via ConnectRPC to a Next.js frontend, enabling push-based, low-latency rendering without polling. The system is designed for clean separation of acquisition, streaming, and UI, with controlled browser reuse and per-ticker isolation for reliability and scalability.",

Evaluated with macro F1-score to account for class imbalance, it delivers strong performance while acknowledging nuanced overlap between classes.
