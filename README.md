# Static Portfolio (React + JSON)

A static portfolio app built with React (Vite). All content is stored in a JSON file that is bundled with the frontend for fully static hosting (GitHub Pages–ready).

## Architecture

- `frontend/src/data/portfolio.json` — content source
- `frontend/` — React app (Vite)

## Run locally

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Editing data

Edit the file directly:

`frontend/src/data/portfolio.json`

Save the file, then refresh the browser.
